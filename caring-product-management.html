                        <p style="color: #fff;">The company was struggling to gain customers under a content-marketing driven subscription model. Instead of being the source of senior living information, they wanted to become the largest referral service for assisted living and in-home care. To do this, they would need a specialist in conversion optimization to help them build a successful marketing funnel.<br><br>
                          They also needed to overhaul several products to appeal to their not as technicnally-savvy demographic.
                            <!-- We had a beta product called public share that the engineers built without any ux guidance. With Public Share anyone with an account can send and distribute as many forms as they please. Instead of tying the account to a paid subscription they would be charged in buckets based on how many form completions they receive, similar to survey monkey.
                            <br><br>
                           Public Share was hidden behind a feature flag in a very fractured beta state.<br><br> <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"> My 
               objective was to rebuild Public Forms to be a major driver of revenue for GoFormz in 2020.</span> -->

                                  <p>As mentioned all of Caring.com's previous concent marketing was educational. "Click to find personal care for your loved ones," "5 ways you can help a family member with dementia."</p>
                                  <p>While this information is definitely helpful, it doesn't drive clicks or action. You can Google this information for free. </p>
                                  <p>My idea was to create clearer call to actions that would drive clicks and conversion. Instead of click to receive personalized care, the message should have a value proposition. More on that later.</p>

                                         Building a conversion funnel from scratch</h3>
                                        <p>Caring.com had never conducted an A/B test of any of their landing pages, emails, or software UI. My role extended far beyond just designing landing pages and emails. I surveyed testing platforms, colaborated with engineering, and built systems to track new leads.
                                          </p>

                                            <p>Will build an A/B testing tool. We conducted tons of resarch on tools available and concluded that there was no way to conduct a clean test with tools such as Optimizely. At that time, Optimizely used javascript to control image and copy tests. There would be a flash that would display tested content over the other. How would we know what the user acted on to convert? Image test A or B?
                                              </p>
                                              <p>Our solution was to build  an in-house URL splitter where we could route specific percentages of traffic to different urls. We could also control which segment, service, (AL or in-home-care), or demographic goes to which landing page so we could build refined pages for different cohorts.
                                                </p>

                                          <p>I was used to getting a directive from my manager to "come up with a bunch of designs and we'll rifle them through our tool". This time around was very different. Andy and I were very calculated about what we wanted to design and build so we woudln't expend resources on tests that may potentially fail.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>We assigned an optimum cost per click based on channel, and what it would cost for them to move down the funnel. This would help us determine what to build for which segments, and at what point in the funnel it would be best to spend design and engineering resources.
                                              </p>

                                            <p>After someone signed up for our service on the landing page but didn't respond to our first phone call I built a drip campaign. I designed and built emails and deployed them through SendGrid. We tested email design here as well, varying templates based on UTM codes. I would track these codes in a spreadsheet to find the optimial design, and best date and time to send to receive maximum conversion.

                                        <p>This was an exciting time for me. After a few years of focusing on conversion I was granted the opportunity to dive into full-stack product design. The CEO and Director of Product and I would have quarterly planning meetins to disucss high-level business objectives. It was up to him and I to define and build viable products to solve these problems.</p>
                                        <p><strong>I love product management</strong>.

Below is a summary of some of the products I worked on.</p>

We wanted to add a Salesforce-like layer to expedite the Agent workflow. This product was 6 months in making.
