                  <p>As a Product Designer (and aspiring Product Manager) I've worked on teams of all sizes on a multitude of products and verticals. As a designer with front-end chops I am aware of the restraints that engineering may have when it comes to limiting the size or scope of a product or feature set. Here are some examples of some products I've created with such constraints while working with other teams (internal and external) to create the most viable product. </p>

                        <p style="color: #fff;">We want to make our product more accessible. Our fremium model dictates 1 user, 1 form template. If you want to send out more templates and more forms you have to become a paid user.<br><br>
                            We had a beta product called public share that the engineers built without any ux guidance. With Public Share anyone with an account can send and distribute as many forms as they please. Instead of tying the account to a paid subscription they would be charged in buckets based on how many form completions they receive, similar to survey monkey.
                         <br><br> <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"> My 
               objective was to rebuild Public Forms to be a major driver of revenue for GoFormz in 2020. I would do this by revewing the end-to-end user experience and create products in addition to redesigning public forms that would maximize it's benefit to the enterprise user.</span>

                                    Increasing the success rate of new user form upload</h3>
                                        <p>The founder (lead engineer) came to me and said we need to reimagine the way users first point of contact with our product. We were currently leveraging a pdf upload service that had a 17% fail rate for no explainable reason. We were going to change services which inspired the discussion to improve the user experience.</p>
                                        <p>As owners of our domain we walked through the upload process. Timing upload time based on size of the file, and measuring fail and success rates. Once we gathered what we considered reasonable bench marks we designed the product around those critiera. 
                                          </p>

                                              <li>At maximum file size, upload should take no more than 3 seconds.</li>
                                              <li>If upload fails user should have states suggesting why the upload failed.</li>
                                              <li>Upon success user should be given clear direction to next steps. </li>

                                       <p>It was just the lead enginer and myself. We did not have an internal product manager. It made communication a bit tricky but we were both pleased with the end result. We added a modern drag-and-drop file upload UI, file requirements, and the ability to contact support via Intercom with any questions the user may have.

                                                Task analysis, conceptualization and new workflows</h3>
                                              <p>I started whiteboarding and wireframing the information architecture for primary use cases. Once the prodduct managers and I had settled on low-fi mockups I collaborated with the product manager and lead developer to discuss scope and technical viability.</p>
                                                <p>Before moving on to high-fidelity comps I like to create two interaction models. One would be MVP, what I know we can build within an accurate timeline with the correctly pointed stories. The other is a nice-to-have. Allowing engineers to pull-in side stories and features when and if they have time. This helps avoid feature creep later on.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Once the beta product was in place we executed task analysis and user testing. We kept the user journey and task analysis pretty simple. Create a public share, fill out the form on your device, then create a basic report. I observed the sales team execute the tasks individually. Our jr. account managers had really good feedback regarding what we can do to optimize this product for their SMB customers. The account executives had a different approach. Instead of feature feedback their feedback was on what they could upsell and what we would need to add to make it an Enterprise feature. </p>

                                      <h4 class="title">Tagging a form and sharing it with the main office</h4>
                                      <p>A powerful feature that users in the field can leverage is tagging. Once a user tags a form, the office manager can easily surface any relevent tags to create future reports. For example, let's say there's a subcontractor who surveys and inspects several job sites in a day but they all share the same base form template. The subcontractor can easily tag each form he completes so it can be referenced at a later date. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The tagging we used in iOS and our Webapp would scale nicely into Android and Material Design. I leveraged experiences from Google Keep to create an intuative, native experience.

For example, let's say you are an office manager and want to figure out how many hours employees spend on inspection job 1 and inspection job 2. You can report across multiple form types to find common form fields, but it was impossible to discover these powerful features.

We would continue to follow the self-guided pattern since it was proving to be successful in accounts that were given beta access public share.</p>

                                        <p>These products are pivotal to growing GoFormz bottom line. It was challenging yet rewarding to create products that would appeal to both the new user and the power user. Once these products were released into product we saw large adoption rates for new customers and enterprise users were quickly expanding their license type and account to gain access to the new products. </p>

                                          <h4>Simplicity is strength</h4>
                                          <p>
                                              As a designer, we are often lured by attractive, trendy and out of the box designs.  But, We must always remember the ‘why’. The primary goal is to understand the user, their problems and then come up with a design that solves it. Wizards may be so 1995 but for most people they are familiar adoptable pattern.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <h4>Prioritize</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                Create a strategic plan to launch an MVP. This helps deal with out-of-scope requests that could potentially derail the project and helps deliver a quality product in time.</p>
                                              <br>
                                              <h4>Seek out feedback early and continually</h4>
                                              <p>
                                                Keeping the stakeholders/users in loop and testing solutions in whatever form (paper, low-fi or hi-fi) as early as possible saves ample amount of time and re-work.</p>
