                  <p>GoFormz Public Share lets you share a form template with people outside of your account, allowing them to create new forms from this template. There are many situations where this is useful. For instance, you may want to place a Work Order form template’s Public Share URL on your website, allowing customers to start a work order electronically by filling out the incident date and reported problem. The partially completed form can then be routed to your company’s dispatchers, who can review it and assign to a technician as appropriate.</p>

                        <p style="color: #fff;">We want to make our product more accessible. Our fremium model dictates 1 user, 1 form template. If you want to send out more templates and more forms you have to become a paid user.<br><br>
                            We had a beta product called public share that the engineers built without any ux guidance. With Public Share anyone with an account can send and distribute as many forms as they please. Instead of tying the account to a paid subscription they would be charged in buckets based on how many form completions they receive, similar to survey monkey.
                         <br><br> <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"> My 
               objective was to rebuild Public Forms to be a major driver of revenue for GoFormz in 2020. I would do this by revewing the end-to-end user experience and create products in addition to redesigning public forms that would maximize it's benefit to the enterprise user.</span>

                          Qualitative Interviews</h3>
                      <p>User research was quintessential. The complex workflows of the multiple user types and their interactions with one another needed to be laid out in detail. In order to achieve that, I gathered as much as I could from the end users to understand the challenges they face and how they see the app making a difference in optimizing pain areas.</p>

                                    Analyzing the beta product</h3>
                                        <p>The first step was to tear apart the old design and build a new user flow that made more sense. Previously the user would be created with nothing but an empy modal and a brief sentence describing the functionality. The primary cta placement made no sense.</p>
                                        <p>After a few user walk throughs the success rate of finding and creating the public share took over 10 seconds. Assuming the user was able to figure out where to start they then proceeded into modal hell. Selecting the fields you want to share with the customer and selecting an experiation date for the public form was disasterous. 
                                          </p>
                                          <p>The final step of sending and sharing a public form may have been the most confusing. Instead of a dashboard all of your public shares were collected in this modal.
                                            </p>

                                                Task analysis, conceptualization and new workflows</h3>
                                              <p>I started whiteboarding and wireframing the information architecture for primary use cases. Once the prodduct managers and I had settled on low-fi mockups I collaborated with the product manager and lead developer to discuss scope and technical viability.</p>
                                                <p>Before moving on to high-fidelity comps I like to create two interaction models. One would be MVP, what I know we can build within an accurate timeline with the correctly pointed stories. The other is a nice-to-have. Allowing engineers to pull-in side stories and features when and if they have time. This helps avoid feature creep later on.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Once the beta product was in place we executed task analysis and user testing. We kept the user journey and task analysis pretty simple. Create a public share, fill out the form on your device, then create a basic report. I observed the sales team execute the tasks individually. Our jr. account managers had really good feedback regarding what we can do to optimize this product for their SMB customers. The account executives had a different approach. Instead of feature feedback their feedback was on what they could upsell and what we would need to add to make it an Enterprise feature. </p>

                                      <h4 class="title">Tagging a form and sharing it with the main office</h4>
                                      <p>A powerful feature that users in the field can leverage is tagging. Once a user tags a form, the office manager can easily surface any relevent tags to create future reports. For example, let's say there's a subcontractor who surveys and inspects several job sites in a day but they all share the same base form template. The subcontractor can easily tag each form he completes so it can be referenced at a later date. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The tagging we used in iOS and our Webapp would scale nicely into Android and Material Design. I leveraged experiences from Google Keep to create an intuative, native experience.

For example, let's say you are an office manager and want to figure out how many hours employees spend on inspection job 1 and inspection job 2. You can report across multiple form types to find common form fields, but it was impossible to discover these powerful features.

                                        <p>Since reporting tools are pretty complex I went through several dozen rounds of whiteboarding and wireframming sessions with the product manager. I also collected a ton of feedback from the account management team who were typically called upont to build reports for customers.</p>
                                        <br>
                                          <p>While our reporting product is far more complex than public share I wanted to unite the experience and continue appleaing to the SMB customer but layering in high-powered enterprise features as you become acclimated to the product. We would continue to follow the self-guided pattern since it was proving to be successful in accounts that were given beta access public share.</p>

                                        <p>I took the guessing game out of a fussy drag-and-drop UI. The user can now choose a guided path or just jumping into a new inutive interface. We decided to make sure the user had a basic report to work off of by adding the option to include data fields that all forms have such as created date, form name, and template name.</p>
                                        <br>
                                          <p>Once the report was created tool tips were added to familiarize the user with the new UI and clue them into what they could do after they finished a report. We wanted to get out of the data analysis business. The objective here was to allow the users to create a report, but then export it to Box then work on it in a system like Excel. </p>

                                              As a designer, we are often lured by attractive, trendy and out of the box designs.  But, We must always remember the ‘why’. The primary goal is to understand the user, their problems and then come up with a design that solves it. Wizards may be so 1995 but for most people they are familiar adoptable pattern.</p>
                                            <br>

                                                Create a strategic plan to launch an MVP. This helps deal with out-of-scope requests that could potentially derail the project and helps deliver a quality product in time.</p>

                                                Keeping the stakeholders/users in loop and testing solutions in whatever form (paper, low-fi or hi-fi) as early as possible saves ample amount of time and re-work.</p>
