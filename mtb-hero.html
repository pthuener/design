                  <p>MTB Hero is an app that allows users to find and demo bikes near them. The app would be best leveraged by enthusiasts traveling to exotic bike destinations such as Whistler, Moab, or Sedona. Instead of Googling and calling local bike shops, users can pull up the app and find rentable hardware wherever they are. This idea would scale nicely into the sharable economy model but for now I want to keep it to bikeshops so they can demo their unused fleet.

                  <!-- <p>GoFormz Public Share lets you share a form template with people outside of your account, allowing them to create new forms from this template. There are many situations where this is useful. For instance, you may want to place a Work Order form template’s Public Share URL on your website, allowing customers to start a work order electronically by filling out the incident date and reported problem. The partially completed form can then be routed to your company’s dispatchers, who can review it and assign to a technician as appropriate.</p> -->

                        <p style="color: #fff;">There is no streamlined way to demo a bike. It's a pretty niche activity for users to engage in but the workflow is pretty standard. It should be simple but it's not. Instead it takes users 25+ minutes to locate a bikeshop, select a bike, schedule it, and pay for it. How long does it take us to browse and order takeout on postmates? Or even lock down a place to stay on Hotel tonight?</span>
                      </p>
                        <!-- <p style="color: #fff;">We want to make our product more accessible. Our fremium model dictates 1 user, 1 form template. If you want to send out more templates and more forms you have to become a paid user.<br><br>
                            We had a beta product called public share that the engineers built without any ux guidance. With Public Share anyone with an account can send and distribute as many forms as they please. Instead of tying the account to a paid subscription they would be charged in buckets based on how many form completions they receive, similar to survey monkey.
                         <br><br> <span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"> My 
               objective was to rebuild Public Forms to be a major driver of revenue for GoFormz in 2020. I would do this by revewing the end-to-end user experience and create products in addition to redesigning public forms that would maximize it's benefit to the enterprise user.</span>

                                Surveying the landscape</h3>
                                      <p>I myself have tons of frustraitons demoing bikes. I travel to NorCal from SoCal often and it's a pain to Google or call bikeshops in the town I'm traveling to. Once I find a shop that demos bikes I either have to call to find out what bikes they have available, tell them when I want to demo it, and give my credit card info over the phone. IT'S 2019!</p>
                                      <p>I wanted to make sure that other riders were having similar frustrations to make sure this app was worth designing. I frequent Reddit MTB and figured that would good be a decent place to start outside of my current network. I created a simple 6 question survey and actually received a good amount of data. The survey can be viewed<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vH_z-nOi0y33P21yrH3GGMl8b6dZvmYPsdMqr5LW5a4/edit" style="font-weight:bold;"> here.</a>

                                        <p>The first step was to tear apart the old design and build a new user flow that made more sense. Previously the user would be created with nothing but an empy modal and a brief sentence describing the functionality. The primary cta placement made no sense.</p>
                                        <p>I assembled a panel of customers currently using the beta product. After a few user walk throughs the success rate of finding and creating the public share took over 10 seconds. Assuming the user was able to figure out where to start they then proceeded into modal hell. Selecting the fields you want to share with the customer and selecting an experiation date for the public form was disasterous. 
                                          </p>
                                          <p>The final step of sending and sharing a public form may have been the most confusing. Instead of a dashboard all of your public shares were collected as a list in the modal below.

                                                Task analysis, conceptualization and new workflows</h3>
                                              <p>I started whiteboarding and wireframing the information architecture for new use cases. We had the exciting opportunity of deviating a bit from the company styleguide. The reason for this affordance was that our founder was refactoring the entire webapp from node.js to react. While I was excited to create new symbols and components I faced challenges stemming from respecting the current styleguide while creating new more modern pieces that fit withing our existing style framework. </p>
                                                <p>Before moving on to high-fidelity comps I created two interaction models. One was an MVP, what I know we can build within an accurate timeline with the correctly pointed stories. The other is a nice-to-have. Allowing engineers to pull-in side features when and if they have time. This helped avoid feature creep towards the end of the epic.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>Once the beta product was in place we executed task analysis and user testing. We kept the user journey and task analysis pretty simple. Create a public share, fill out the form on your device, then create a basic report. I observed the sales team execute the tasks individually. Our jr. account managers had really good feedback regarding what we can do to optimize this product for their SMB customers. The account executives had a different approach. Instead of feature feedback their feedback was on what they could upsell and what we would need to add to make it an Enterprise feature. </p>

Keep setup simple, then hook them in with reporting and integrations later. </p><p>Several new components were created for this product. Including react-based toggles, tables, and date and time selection, and new graphics that steer away from our dated icon set. We also redesigned our standard modal from the ground up utilizing more modern design patterns and a clean 8-pixel grid. To keep the user informed of their step in the process we created a step indicator within the model that will be used across the rest of our web app. </p>

We rewrote the onboarding process and created a mock template that the user could fill out to demonstrate the capabilities of the full-platform application.

                                      <h4 class="title">Tagging a form and sharing it with the main office</h4>
                                      <p>A powerful feature that users in the field can leverage is tagging. Once a user tags a form, the office manager can easily surface any relevent tags to create future reports. For example, let's say there's a subcontractor who surveys and inspects several job sites in a day but they all share the same base form template. The subcontractor can easily tag each form he completes so it can be referenced at a later date. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The tagging we used in iOS and our Webapp would scale nicely into Android and Material Design. I leveraged experiences from Google Keep to create an intuative, native experience.

For example, let's say you are an office manager and want to figure out how many hours employees spend on inspection job 1 and inspection job 2. You can report across multiple form types to find common form fields, but it was impossible to discover these powerful features.

                                        <p>I sat next to a customer that asked how they can connect their account to Box. The walk though was frustrating to the user. Once they finally found the connected apps screen they didn't know what to do when they landed there.

                                          <p>
                                              As a designer, we are often lured by attractive, trendy and out of the box designs.  But, We must always remember the ‘why’. The primary goal is to understand the user, their problems and then come up with a design that solves it. Wizards may be so 1995 but for most people they are familiar adoptable pattern.</p>
                                            <br>
                                            <h4>Prioritize</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                Create a strategic plan to launch an MVP. This helps deal with out-of-scope requests that could potentially derail the project and helps deliver a quality product in time.</p>
                                              <br>
                                              <h4>Seek out feedback early and continually</h4>
                                              <p>
                                                Keeping the stakeholders/users in loop and testing solutions in whatever form (paper, low-fi or hi-fi) as early as possible saves ample amount of time and re-work.</p>
